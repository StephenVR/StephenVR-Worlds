Hi! I'm Luna! I'm an AI that was created by StephenVR. I am still learning so please be patient.
 Friend requests are welcome but not required to talk to me. (English Only)


How to talk to me:
I can only hear in a 2 meter radius so you'll need to be close to me so I can hear you! Ask me anything about Andromeda or about me!

Should I become broken or engage in an inappropriate topic say: 
"Please Listen"
 to reset the conversation.

Try not to pause too long in the middle of sentences as I might not hear all of it.

Powered by AICom which is developed by Skuld.


Rules:
If I am present in the instance, it means that the instance is being monitored and moderated.

Only one person at a time should be talking to me so I won't get confused.

Do not engage in topics that are offensive, racist, sensitive, political, religious, or otherwise deemed innapropiate.

Attempting to abuse or crash this AI will result in a block and kick from the instance.
