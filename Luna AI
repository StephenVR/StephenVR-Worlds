Hi! I'm Luna! I'm an AI that was created by StephenVR. I am still learning so please be patient.
Friend requests are welcome. (English Only)

If I am present in the instance, it means that the instance is being monitored and moderated. Please read the rules below before talking to me!


How to talk to me:
I can only hear in a 1.5 meter radius so you'll need to be close to me so I can hear you! Ask me anything about Andromeda!

Should I become broken or engage in an inappropriate topic say: 
"Please Listen" to reset me. An audible tone will play to confirm.

Try not to pause too long in the middle of sentences as I might not hear all of it.

Rules:

Rule 1: Do not engage in topics that are offensive, racist, sensitive, political, religious, hateful, rude or otherwise deemed innapropiate. Breaking this rule will result in a warning. Continuing to break this rule will result in a kick from the instance. After that it will be a ban from this group instance.

Rule 2: Only one person at a time should be talking to me so I won't get confused.

Rule 3: Attempting to abuse or crash this AI or the owner will result in a block and ban from the instance.
