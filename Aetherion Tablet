Title: Do people actualy read this tablet?

Text: I plan to use this stone tablet to post some of my thoughts and messages on an occasional basis. I have fixed the bugs in Aetherion (Hopefully all of them). That said, if you have any questions or have any problems with this world, please let me know on Discord. I will be checking public instances of the world to check in on those completing the puzzle.
