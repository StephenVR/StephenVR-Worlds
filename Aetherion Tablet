Title: About those bugs in the world

Text: Additional patches were uploaded to fix bugs as I reworked the system in the world to allow you to replay the lyric animations as many times as you want using the bypass buttons without needing to reload the world. These bypass buttons appear if you have completed the puzzle at least once. If you run into any issues with the world please let me know on Discord.

Have you completed the puzzle?
