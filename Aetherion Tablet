Title: My thoughts lately

Text: Sometimes people ask me why I keep going despite the slow progress lately. While the project hasn't been full priority lately as I've been working on other things including Aetherion, I will not stop until I see my story finished. This was a promise I made to myself. 

Have you completed the puzzle?
