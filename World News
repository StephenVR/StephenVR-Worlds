StephenVR World Updates December 6th, 2025
I have finished writing Andromeda Chapter 6. World updates to Andromeda and Citadel of New Earth will follow eventually in early 2026.
The New Earth Shrine worlds have received minor design updates as well as fps optimizations. The island shrine world is the last world to be updated and it will be getting a remake.
I have a booth at Vket 2025 Winter in the world Kowloon Empire - Void Alley - Orderless. Be sure to visit!
