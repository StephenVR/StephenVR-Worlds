StephenVR World Updates August 22nd, 2024
Release of The Crystal Core of New Earth is delayed due to voice lines not being finished from one of our va's. The world development itself is finished just waiting on voice actors to finish voice lines.
For now, visit The Grand Shrine of New Earth if you want to visit the core by using the surface elevator.
