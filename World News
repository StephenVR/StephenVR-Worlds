StephenVR World Updates November 23rd, 2025
I have finished writing Andromeda Chapter 6. World updates to Andromeda and Citadel of New Earth will follow eventually in early 2026.
The New Earth Shrine worlds have received minor design updates as well as fps optimizations. The island shrine world is the last world to be updated and it will be getting a remake.
Known bug: In the shrine worlds with offering boxes, coins currently do not spawn. Will be fixing this.
