StephenVR World Updates February 19th, 2024
New World "Aetherion" will be releasing early Friday February 21st. I have decided to swap the lyric animations meaning the song "When The Summer Ends" by Days to Waste will be the primary lyric animation and the alternate one will be the one Katsumi aka Zerzura_VR is making, which will be added in a later update.
