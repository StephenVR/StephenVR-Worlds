StephenVR World Updates November 24th, 2025
I have finished writing Andromeda Chapter 6. World updates to Andromeda and Citadel of New Earth will follow eventually in early 2026.
The New Earth Shrine worlds have received minor design updates as well as fps optimizations. The island shrine world is the last world to be updated and it will be getting a remake.
In the shrine worlds with offering boxes a new coin system has been added.
