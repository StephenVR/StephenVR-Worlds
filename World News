StephenVR World Updates October 1st, 2025
I have released my next VRChat world Valhalla. You can find the world in the new worlds row or on my profile. Feedback or bug reports on this would can be sent to me in my Discord server. Be sure to talk to Luna!
Updated the world so that the save system now saves beacon progress individually and saves the radio sync quest. Existing saves are unaffected.
I have disabled the kill system for now.
