StephenVR World Updates June 3rd, 2023
A new world called "Lonely Sunset" has been completed and will be released next week on Monday June 5th. Modeling of the gift world from my friend Monomory is in progress and development of the New Earth Citadel has resumed.
I have started streaming on Twitch where I stream once or twice a week. Come say hello sometime while I'm live.
