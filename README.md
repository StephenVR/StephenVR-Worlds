This repository is used in my VRChat worlds for the remote updating of my information panels and Patreon boards. It is also used for execution of events in certain worlds and for sending messages on the message tablet.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fcd1496-59a0-4a17-9886-110f0e007051)
